Knight,FakeNews: #EZPZ There are totally around 100 image displayed with image captions generated by NeuralTalk2. The images crawled from fake news are marked as 'Fake' at the beginning of each caption. I also selected some typical images to compare their caption along with their own news title and news topic which is generated by TopicModel. Theses 3 attributes are sepreated by / delimiter in the oder of caption/title/topic. More work is reaching on the comparision of these 3 attributes of an image to define its a fake on or note.Knight,FakeNews: #EZPZ There are totally around 100 image displayed with image captions generated by NeuralTalk2.
